## 📐 Design and Architecture<a name="design-and-architecture"></a>

The Yacht Listings App follows a modular and component-based architecture, leveraging the Next.js framework for server-side rendering and React for building the user interface. The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling, Shadcn and Radix UI for component primitives. The data fetching is handled asynchronously using React hooks, and lazy loading techniques are implemented for images to optimize performance. The project structure is organized to promote maintainability and scalability.

## 🤔 What could be done differently<a name="what-could-be-done-differently"></a>

During the development of this Yacht Listings App, one area where I recognize room for improvement is in adopting a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. In an ideal scenario, TDD involves writing tests before implementing features, fostering the creation of more robust and maintainable code. While I understand the benefits of TDD, due to time constraints during the development phase, I opted for a more rapid development cycle to fulfill the required functionalities.

In future iterations of the application, I would consider dedicating more time to establishing a solid testing foundation. Introducing a testing framework, such as Jest, and crafting unit tests for critical components and functionalities would undoubtedly contribute to the overall reliability of this application.
